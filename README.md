# GENAI Workshop - Conducted by INVENTIA (GDG) on Campus KARE

This repository contains materials and resources from the **GENAI Workshop** conducted by INVENTIA, in collaboration with Google Developer Group (GDG) at the **Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education (KARE)**. The workshop focused on applying NLP techniques and using generative AI models from Hugging Face and Google AI Studio.

## Workshop Overview

### Day 1

#### 1. Data Preprocessing using NLP
Participants were introduced to data preprocessing techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This session covered:

- Tokenization
- Stop word removal
- Stemming and lemmatization
- Text cleaning

#### 2. SMS Spam Prediction using NLP and Naive Bayes
The second session focused on building a spam prediction model using:

- Preprocessing techniques discussed earlier
- Training a Naive Bayes classifier for SMS spam detection
- Evaluating model performance with accuracy metrics

### Day 2

#### 1. Using Different Models with Hugging Face API Keys
Participants explored various NLP models using Hugging Face. This session covered:

- Setting up Hugging Face API keys
- Selecting pre-trained models for specific NLP tasks
- Running inference on text inputs using different models

#### 2. Generative Model for Text and Image Generation using Google AI Studio API
The final session involved working with **Google AI Studio API** to:

- Create a generative model for text and image generation
- Integrate the model with external applications
- Experiment with custom fine-tuning for generative tasks

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Google AI Studio
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Generative AI
